Submitted to Advanced functional materials journal

Herein, we fabricated  Ti3C2Tx/ SnSe2 nanohybrid based multifunctional physical sensors (pressure, strain, and temperature) on the cotton substrate for non-invasive healthcare monitoring. The fabricated nanohybrid E-textile based physical sensors displayed an improved sensitivity of 14.959 kPa-1 for 1.477 â€“ 3.456 kPa of the applied external pressure and an enhanced gauge factor of 14.108 for 5-25% of applied strain. In addition, these physical sensors have shown exceptional stability of ~2500 cycles for a pressure sensor and ~3000 cycles for a strain sensor which signifies the sturdiness of the sensor. Furthermore, the fabricated temperature sensor has displayed a TCR value of 7.943 x 10-3 oC-1 and a high activation energy value of 300.684 meV. Further, an android/iOS/web-based app was developed to validate wireless integration of the fabricated multifunctional physical sensors by utilizing a simple electronic circuit. Also, there are no investigations/reports on Ti3C2Tx/ SnSe2 nanohybrid physical sensor-based applications as per the author's knowledge.  The successful demonstration of Ti3C2Tx/ SnSe2 nanohybrid E-textile based multifunctional physical sensor commences new possibilities for advanced health care and medical applications.
